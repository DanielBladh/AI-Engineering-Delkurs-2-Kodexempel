First, here is the context information you should use to inform your answers:

<context>
{{In the Loge, also known as At the Opera, is an 1878 Impressionist painting by the American artist Mary Cassatt. The oil-on-canvas painting is currently in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which also holds a preliminary drawing for the work.[1] The painting displays a bourgeois woman at the opera house looking through her opera glasses, while a man in the background looks at her.[2] The woman's costume and fan make clear her upper class status.[2] Art historians see the painting as commentary on the role of gender, looking, and power in the social spaces of the nineteenth century.[2][3]

Background
Personal identity
Cassatt's female subjects are often seen as an extension of her personal life. Cassatt had an early passion for painting and convinced her father to allow her to attend art school at a time when it was unusual for women to do so.[2] After her father gave her permission to study at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, she moved to Paris, where she practiced as a painter and exhibited with the Impressionists. The art historian Susan Yeh has argued that Cassatt's female subjects, like Cassatt herself, overcome gender stereotypes and pursue independence.[2]

Impressionism
Cassatt was introduced to Impressionism by Edgar Degas. Impressionist painters often painted social settings such as cafes, popular boulevards, and opera houses.[4] This new movement satisfied Cassatt's desire to make art that was relevant to modern life.[5] Like other Impressionist painters, Cassatt used loose brushstrokes to capture fleeting moments in time. Cassatt was empowered by the Impressionists to choose her own subject matter, ignoring the historical genres favored by the French Academy.[2]

The Opera House
In the Loge takes place in an elevated floor of an opera house. During the 19th century, the opera house was not only a place to watch a performance, but also a social gathering where high-class and bourgeois people would mingle.[6] It served as one of the only social settings that women could freely attend. Cassatt's choice of setting for In the Loge has been interpreted by scholars as a means of highlighting the growing agency of women in nineteenth-century society.[4]

Similar paintings
Mary Cassatt produced several other paintings depicting scenes in the opera house, such as The Loge and Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge. Pierre Auguste Renoir also depicted a similar subject in La Loge (The Theatre Box), but his approach to the subject differs from Cassatt's.[3] While Renoir paints his female subjects in order to display their physical features, Cassatt gives her female subject a more active role.[5]}}
